Welcome to the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) best practices guides. The aim of this project is to offer prescriptive guidance for utilizing ELB in the AWS Cloud. The content in the guides is a collection of best practices aligned with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/){:target="_blank"} and other sources such as the AWS documentation, AWS Whitepapers, Amazon Builders' Library. As the ELB Team, we have incorporated insights gained from our direct experiences with customers. We also welcome suggestions from the community.

We currently have published guides for the following topics:

* [ELB Best Practices for Security](security/)
    * [Data Protection](security/data_protection)
    * [Incident Response](security/incident_response)
    * [Infrastructure Protection](security/infrastructure_protection)
    * [Security Assurance](security/security_assurance)
    * [Vulnerability Management](security/vulnerability_management)
* [ELB Best Practices for Reliability](reliability/)
    * [Data Protection](reliability/failure_management)
    * [Incident Response](reliability/workload_architecture)


We have plans to extend the guides to include a variety of topics such as Performance, Observability and Scaling.

## About

This guide was conceived by the ELB Customer Success team, inspired by the [EKS Best Practices Guides](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/){:target="_blank"}.

We chose to publish it on GitHub to allow for quicker iterations and, most importantly, to capture and incorporate feedback from the community.
