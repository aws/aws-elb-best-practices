## How to use this guide

This guide is meant to provide generic best practices for architects, developers and engineers responsible for designing, deploying and operating a system that leverage Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for traffic distribution.

This guide covers two types of Elastic Load Balancing services: Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB). Unless stated otherwise in a specific section, the best practice are applicable to both. We may sometimes use term 'ELB' (Elastic Load Balancing) to refer collectively to both ALB and NLB.

Each topic presents a brief overview, followed by recommendations and best practices. Topics can be read in any order order   and it's essential to test and validate recommendations to ensure they align with your specific requirements.
